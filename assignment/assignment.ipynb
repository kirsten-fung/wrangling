        "**Q1.** Open the \"tidy_data.pdf\" document in the repo, which is a paper called Tidy Data by Hadley Wickham.\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
        "\n",
        "     * This paper is about the importance of data tidying for data cleaning. The specific and standard structure of tidy data and its tools makes it easier to eventually perform data analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
        "\n",
        "     * From the text, the \"tidy data standard\" was designed to facilitate initial exploration and analysis of the data, and to simplify the development of data analysis tools that work well together. Tidy datasets are meant to make data cleaning and analysis easier by structuring them in a uniform and universally understandable way.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "     * The first sentence is comparing datasets to families, saying that tidy datasets have the same organized structure no matter which one you look at. It is easy to interpret them every single time. On the other hand, messy datasets, just like unhappy families, all have different reasons for their disorder. They are all unique in their problems and it is difficult to figure out what's wrong.\n",
        "     * The second sentence is saying that in theory, it is straighfoward and easy to identify observations and variables due to their definition. However, in practice, it is harder to be able to do this as it is up to the person to make that decision.\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
        "\n",
        "     * Values: is what makes up a dataset, usually either numbers (if quantitative) or strings (if qualitative)\n",
        "     * Variables: contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute across units (like height, temp, duration)\n",
        "     * Observations: contains all values measured on the same unit across attributes (like person, day, race)\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
        "\n",
        "     * Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure where each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table.\n",
        "\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        "     \n",
        "     * The 5 most common problems with dmessy datasets are (1) column headers are values, not variable names, (2) multiple variables are stored in one column, (3) variables are stored in both rows and columns, (4) multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table, and (5) a single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.\n",
        "     * Table 4 is messy because the column headers are values for a variable that should be \"Income\". There should be 2 column variables: income and religion.\n",
        "     * \"Melting\" a dataset is turning columns into rows\n",
        "\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "     * Table 11 has values (days) as column headers and there are multiple variables stored in one column (tmax, tmin) instead of values. Table 12 is \"molten\" because it converted those separate day columns into one data column with values in it. However, it still has tmax and tmin stored in one column. The tidy data splits up the two and puts numeric values under each.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "\n",
        "     * The \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data is that if these tools can only be used for tidy data, then it is stuck in a loop where it is dependent on itself for the continuous development of tools designed for it. Wickham hopes that tidy data is just a starting point for even better ways to store data and tools for data analysis in the future."
