        "\n",
        "     * This paper is about the importance of data tidying for data cleaning. The specific structure of tidy data and its tools makes it easier to eventually perform data analysis.\n",

        "\n",
        "     * The \"tidy data standard\" was designed to facilitate initial exploration and analysis of the data, and to sumplify the development of data analysis tools that work well together.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "     * The first sentence is comparing datasets to families, saying that tidy datasets have the same organized structure not matter which one you look at. It is easy to interpret them every single time. On the other hand, messy datasets, just like unhappy families, all have different reasons for their disorder. They are all unique in their problems and it is difficult to figure out what's wrong.\n",
        "     * The second sentence is saying that it is usually straighfoward and easy to identify observations and variables. However, it gets harder to be able to find a universal definition for variable and observations that can apply to all datasets.\n",
